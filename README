Directives

    jitify
        syntax: jitify <varval>

        default: 0

        use a numeric value to configure if the feature is on
        and what it acts upon with a bitset.
        js: 1
        css: 2
        html: 4
        (so all on = 7)

        NOTE: <varval> is either a fixed numeric value at configuration
        or a variable that takes its value during execution time
